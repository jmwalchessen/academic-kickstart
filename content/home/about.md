# About
Entering my fourth year as a PhD student in the department of Statistics and Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), my primary focus has been on uncertainty quantification for ill-posed inverse problems in the physical sciences. In particular, I have worked on methods in carbon flux inversion with collaborators at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and particle unfolding with my advisor, Mikael Kuusela at CMU. Additionally, I have an on-going collaboration with the Owhadi Group at Caltech on a related decision theoretic approach to uncertainty quantification.
